This is a tic tac toe game, that I made using Claude.  I wanted to explore game design and coding, with AI behaviors using AI as part of the development process.  
I was also interested in seeing if there was potential for computational strategy simulation, which clearly there is.  

The prompt I used to create this was...
"Write a game of tic tac toe in javascript with a virtual competitor.  A user should be able to say if they want to go first or second."

Here is a screenshot of the game.
